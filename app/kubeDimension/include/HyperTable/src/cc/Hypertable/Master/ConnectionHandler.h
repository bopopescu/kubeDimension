  /** Handles incoming Master requests.
   * An object of this class is installed as the dispatch handler for the listen
   * socket on which the Master receives client connections and requests. To
   * handle transparent master failover while requests are being carried out,
   * most requests happen in two phases:
   *
   *  1. An operation is created to carry out the request and its ID is sent
   *     back to client
   *  2. %Client issues MasterProtocol::COMMAND_FETCH_RESULT request to
   *     fetch result of operation
   * 
   * After the operation has been created and persisted to the MML and the ID
   * has been sent back to the client, the Master can fail and when the new
   * Master comes up, it will complete the operation and send the results back
   * to the client.  This class also installs an interval timer and installs
   * itself as the handler.  When handling TIMER events, it checks to see if any
   * of the following actions are necessary, and if so, it will create
   * operations to carry them out.
   *
   *   - Statistics gathering
   *   - Garbage collection
   *   - Balancing
