The OpenCV driver allows to stream video from OpenCV VideoCapture, which can be either a camera or
a file.

Usage:
	opencv:[id=<video_device_id>]
			- OR -
	opencv://<path_to_video_file>
	
Examples:
	opencv:[id=2]
	opencv:///media/lameusername/data/cap/video1_h264.mp4

Note that if the <path_to_video_file> is used together with the id property, the id will be ignored.
