The Join driver allows to join image streams from an arbitrary number of other HAL drivers.

Usage:
	join://<driver1>&<driver2>&...&<driverN>

Example:
	join://node://client1/images&node://client2/images

Note that if used in the command line you need to escape the character '&' or to write all
the driver line between quotes. Examples:
  ./SensorViewer -cam join://node://client1/images\&node://client2/images
  ./SensorViewer -cam "join://node://client1/images&node://client2/images"
