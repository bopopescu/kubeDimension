You must install NX client on any computer from which you wish to work.  Also because IWCT launches computer resource on the public Amazon Web Services cloud, youâ€™ll need to create an AWS account.

.. note:: You'll need to provide a credit card and phone number to create an AWS account.

Install NX Client
-----------------

The `NX client <http://turing.une.edu.au/~comp131/FAQs/nxclient/>`_ allows you to use another computer remotely as if it were your local machine.  It provides a fast full-screen GUI session even across poor connections.  Please install the NX client for your OS:

 - `Linux <http://graphics.stanford.edu/~heathkh/projects/nx/client/linux/>`_
 - `Mac OSX 10.3-10.6 <http://graphics.stanford.edu/~heathkh/projects/nx/client/mac/nxclient-3.5.0-7.pkg.zip>`_
 - `Mac OSX 10.7 <http://graphics.stanford.edu/~heathkh/projects/nx/client/mac/OpenNX-0.16.0.729.dmg>`_
 - `Windows <http://graphics.stanford.edu/~heathkh/projects/nx/client/win/>`_


.. _create_aws_account:

Create AWS Account
------------------

#. Go to http://aws.amazon.com
#. Click the **Sign Up** button
#. Follow the on-screen instructions


.. note::   
   If you are a student or researcher, you can `request a grant <http://aws.amazon.com/grants/>`_ for free AWS credits.  When your grant credit is exhausted, your credit card will be charged once again.    
   
.. warning::
   You are responsible for any charges you accrue for use of AWS resources.  When you complete a work session, always login to your `AWS management console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/>`_ and check that your workstation instances are stopped and your cluster instances terminated to avoid accidently wasting resources.
