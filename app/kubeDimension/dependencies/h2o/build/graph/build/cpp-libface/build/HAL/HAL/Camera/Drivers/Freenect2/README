To use this driver:
- Install libfreenect2 by doing:
  git clone https://github.com/dorian3d/libfreenect2.git

Remember to do make install.

If runtime fails, make sure the Kinect2 is connected to a USB 3.0 port and that it is recognized by the system in the USB 3.0 SuperSpeed Bus. Note that if it appears in the USB 3.0 Hi-Speed Bus (which actually is USB 2.0), the camera will not work.
 
In MacOs, it has been shown effective to plug the camera to the USB port first and then to the power.
